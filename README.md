I am a Computer Science student at UC3M.
I am eager to enhance my programming skills and gain knowledge in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Architecture.
I am known for being a diligent and hard-working student. 

Some of my current knowledge areas are:

  - Distributed systems (queue theory, sockets and RPC).
  - Computer architecture (including parallelism using OpenMP in C++).
  - Web development using HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
  - Assembly programming: basic level on MIPS-32.
  - Machine Learning: I have some experience using linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and boosting algorithms.
